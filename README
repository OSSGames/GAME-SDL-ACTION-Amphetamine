You can customize most controls by copying the file user.conf
from the Amphetamine data directory to your ~/.amph directory.
Modify it to suit your needs.

GAMEPLAY

Many aspect of the gameplay are controlled by the file amph.conf
in the main Amphetamine directory. Of most interest are the options
right at the beginning of the file that control the physics. If the 
game seems to slow/fast to you, changing some of those values may help.

DGA MODE

Use the option --fullscreen to enable DGA fullscreen support. I cannot test
this myself, because my X Server does not support it properly. I am grateful
for any feedback regarding this option. 

SPARC/Solaris

I was told that Amphetamine runs very slow on some SPARC machines.
