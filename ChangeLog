Shape.cpp, Surface.cpp:
    -	included <memory.h>
	
System.hpp, Makefile:
	Endianness is now autodetected through SDL_BYTEORDER, so there is
	no need for the BYTE_ORDER variable in the Makefile anymore.
	
Object.cpp, Things.cpp, Monster.cpp, Monstrxx.cpp:
	Initialize some more member variables in the constructors, especially in
	Monstrxx.cpp. Some of the variables where indeed uninitialized, e.g.
	"lastShoot", "currentShootDelay", and "nextShootTime". These changes 
	fix the bug where mosters just seem to freeze and don't move 
	and shoot despite being "alive".

Level.cpp:                                                                            
    -   included <string.h>.
	Amphetamine should now compile under Linux Mandrake 8.0.

March 27th, 2001:

Endianess is now controlled by a seperate variable "BYTE_ORDER", which can
be set to either "LITTLE_ENDIAN" (the default) or "BIG_ENDIAN".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMaskedShape::Encode(), 
CMaskedShape::RenderShapeClipped()
CMaskedShape::RenderShapeUnclipped()

These functions make must read/write 4-byte words at unaligned memory 
locations. To avoid problems on architectures that require strict 
alignment, the macros SET_LONG and GET_LONG perform slow byte-wise
access by default. If you are on IA-32 and "make" detects this, the
macro __OPT_MEM_ACCESS__ will be defined to enable faster versions of
SET_LONG and GET_LONG.

Surface.cpp: CGraphicSurface::PaintGraphic()
	- replaced alignment dependent memory copy code by a call to "memcpy",
	  because it's fast enough and simpler this way

Shape.cpp: CTexture::RenderShape() and CBackground::RenderShape()
	- replaced alignment dependent memory copy code by a call to "memcpy",
	  because it's fast enough and simpler this way

System.cpp/.hpp: 
	- removed support for libsge
