1. Make sure SDL is installed correctly.

2. Have a look at the 'Makefile' and edit it where appropriate.
   - 'USE_LIB_XPM=FALSE' if you don't have libXpm
   
3. Type 'make'. This should build the Amphetamine binary. You can safely
   ignore the numerous warnings. If the compilation fails, you are in
   in trouble. Try to tweak the 'Makefile'. You have to delete
   '-funroll-loops' if you are still using gcc 2.7.2.3 
   
4. Become root and type 'make install'. This will install the binary to
   the directory specified in the makefile (default is '/usr/local/games/amph').
   It will also create a symbolic link.

5. You have managed the difficult bit. Now, you have to install the data files
   required by the game. Get 'amphetamine-${VERSION}.tar.bz' an do:
   - cd /usr/local/games
   - bzip2 -cd ~/amphetamine-data-0.8.tar.bz | tar xv
   
   (Note: the exact commands depend on your syste configuration)     

6. type 'amph' in order to run the game and have fun!
